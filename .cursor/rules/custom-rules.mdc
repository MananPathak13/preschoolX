# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

[context.md](mdc:docs/context.md) - this is the file for the context 
[database-design.md](mdc:docs/database-design.md)  - This is the file where the database design structure is stored. Now we need to make sure whenevery we change something, we need to update these files for the developers to understand what we changed.
